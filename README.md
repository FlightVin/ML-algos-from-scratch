# ML-algos-from-scratch
A bunch of basic ML algorithms from scratch for the course Statictical Methods in AI

## Topics

1. _KNN-DecisionTrees_
	- K Nearest Neighbours from scratch using Numpy, etc.
	- Decision Trees (Powerset and Multi-output formulation) using inbuilt SciPy Decision Tree functions

2. _PCA-GMM-HierClustering_
	- PCA from scratch
	- GMM-EM Algorithm from Scratch
	- Hierarchical Clustering using inbuilt SciPy Functions
	- A few more tasks such as paragraph detection in images
